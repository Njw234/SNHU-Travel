. Introduction
Throughout the SNHU Travel project, I learned how Agile and Scrum practices can be applied to manage real-world software development. This project challenged me to think like a developer working in a collaborative environment—balancing user needs, teamwork, and iteration. The Sprint Review and Retrospective gave me the chance to reflect on my development process, evaluate what went well, and identify areas for improvement. Below are my reflections on the essential questions for the Computer Science program.

.How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
For the SNHU Travel project, I interpreted user needs by focusing on the core goal of helping travelers find and plan trips easily. I began by translating requirements into user stories, such as “As a traveler, I want to browse available destinations so I can choose one that fits my budget and interests.” By turning user needs into actionable tasks, I ensured that every feature supported a real user outcome. Each sprint gave me a chance to test, refine, and verify that the final program aligned with user expectations.

. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach software development through iteration and adaptability. Using Agile methods like sprint planning, retrospectives, and backlog grooming allowed me to stay focused on priorities while still leaving room for improvement. During the SNHU Travel project, I learned the value of delivering small, functional updates rather than trying to complete everything at once. In future projects, I plan to use Scrum ceremonies regularly—especially sprint reviews and retrospectives—to improve communication, track progress, and adapt quickly to change.

.What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating effectively, supporting others, and taking accountability for your work. Collaboration was a major part of the SNHU Travel project. Sharing updates, reviewing feedback, and offering help when teammates were stuck made the process smoother and more rewarding. I also learned that listening and flexibility are just as important as coding skill. In future development teams, I’ll continue to focus on collaboration and clear communication to create an environment where everyone can succeed.
